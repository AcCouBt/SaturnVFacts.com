<pre><p>A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an Earth-centered orbit near the planet, often specified as
 having an orbital period of 128 minutes or less (making at least 11.25 orbits per day) and 
an eccentricity less than 0.25.[1] Most of the artificial objects in outer space are in LEO, 
with an altitude never more than about one-third of the radius of Earth.</p></pre>
