<h1>LEO - Lower Earth Orbit</h1>
<pre><p>A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an Earth-centered orbit near the planet, often 
specified ashaving an orbital period of 128 minutes or less (making at least 
11.25 orbits per day) and an eccentricity less than 0.25.[1] Most of the 
artificial objects in outer space are in LEO, with an altitude never more than 
about one-third of the radius of Earth.</p></pre>
